1.  Introduction

   The purpose of this document is simple.  To explain to you the
   creation of a TCP protocol that creates a socket communication with
   headers between a server and multiple clients that want to send to
   the server a request at the same time.

   This document follows the keyword use as specified in RFC2119
   [RFC2119].

2.  Terminology

   This document uses the following terms:

      Protocol - A pre-approved communication language between two end
      systems.In our case the protocol will be TCP.

      Server - The part of the communication protocol that receives the
      request.  In this project the server receives the request and
      sends back the message that suits to every possible outcome.

      Client - The part of the communication protocol that starts the
      request.  In this project the client gives the numbers that want
      to sum,average or sum of two different array lists .

      byte - An 8-bit octet

3.  Protocol Overview

   In the lines that follows you can see a high-level overview of the
   message exchange between the server and the client:

4.  Protocol Header Format

4.1.  First header

   This is the first message sent by the Client to initiate the
   communication process...

   To this message the client will select one of the three available
   mathematical operations(sum,average or sum of two different array
   lists).

   The client will also select how much will be the numbers that will
   take part at the mathimatical operation.

   After all the things that the client will select above he/she wait
   for the server response message and the result.

   *  Message Type - 16 bits unsigned short: The message type.  For this
      message, the message type MUST be 0.

   *  Length - 16 bits unsigned integer: The Length of the message that
      will be sent.

   *  a - 16 bits unsigned short: The number(1,2 or 3) of one of three
      available mathematical operations.  The value for this message
      MUST be 4.

   *  b - 16 bits unsigned short: The selected numbers that will take
      part at the mathimatical operation.The value for this message MUST
      be 4.

   *  Numbers to be sent - (number of bits that will be calculated)
      short.  The value for this message MUST be 8 at every line.

4.2.  Second header

   This is the second message sent by the Server to give to the client a
   response message and a result of the mathematical operations.

   To this message the server will send the result to the client if
   there is no problems.

   The server will also send a sentence with a message of error if the
   credentials will not be right or message that all have been
   succesfully done.

   After all the server will also calculate the padding of the last raw
   so the message will be well-formed.

   *  Sentence - (number of bits that will be calculated) char: The
      sentence of error or well done that will be sent back.

   *  Padding - (number of bits that will be calculated) x.  The value
      for this message will be affected from the sentence length.

5.  Acknowledgements

   Finally i want to thank you for the attendance of the Project.

   Also i want to thank you about the time that you spent to see my job
   on this Project.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This memo makes no requests to IANA.

   You could though! ;)

7.  Security Considerations

   There is no security in this specification.  This is a prototype and
   all messages should be sent in cleartext over the wire.

   This is a VERY unsecure protocol.  Please do not implement.
